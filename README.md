FSharp.CLI
==========

A very simple Library using F#'s record types as command-line argument definition.

An example can be found in FSharp.CLI.Tests. The library currently only supports very basic features and I will extend it when needed.
Please feel free to contribute.

I'm planning to use a GetOpt implementation underneath to ensure posix comliance.
